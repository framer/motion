/**
 * A hook that returns `true` if we should be using reduced motion based on the current device's Reduced Motion setting.
 *
 * This can be used to implement changes to your UI based on Reduced Motion. For instance, replacing motion-sickness inducing
 * `x`/`y` animations with `opacity`, disabling the autoplay of background videos, or turning off parallax motion.
 *
 * It will actively respond to changes and re-render your components with the latest setting.
