### Added

-   `whileDrag`

-   `whileHover`, `whileTap` and `exit` all now accept variant lists.

### Changed

-   New behaviour for when values are removed from animation props (`animate`, `whileHover`, `exit` etc). The value will be searched for in active props of a lower priority running (`style` <- `animate` <- `whileHover` <- `whileTap` <- `whileDrag` <- `exit`). This may introduce subtle behavioural changes, hence the major.

### Removed

-   The deprecated `useInvertedScale` hook. Use the `layout` prop instead.
-   The deprecated `yoyo`, `flip` and `loop` options. Use `repeat` and `repeatType` options instead.

### Fixed

### Added

-   `animate` function for low-level single `MotionValue` or arbitrary value animations.

## [2.7.8] 2020-10-07

## [2.7.8] 2020-10-07

### Changed

-   If `dragConstraints` is set to a ref on a non-draggable component, we resolve the constraints on mount in order to pass them to `onMeasureDragConstraints`.

## [2.7.7] 2020-10-01

### Fixed

-   `duration` and `bounce` are now overridden by `damping`, `stiffness`, and `mass`. This fixes an issue in Framer where legacy transitions were breaking.

## [2.7.6] 2020-09-29

### Fixed

-   When a `transform` is provided to `style` as a `MotionValue` and then replaced with a number on a subsequent render, we create a new `MotionValue` for it.

### Fixed

-   Manually setting a `from` in `transition`.

## [2.7.4] 2020-09-26

### Fixed

-   Blocks propagation of variants from parent if a component's `animate` prop is set to `AnimationControls`. `inherit` can be used to force inheritence `true` or `false`.

## [2.7.3] 2020-09-25

### Fixed

-   Blocks touch viewport scrolling from draggable components on a per-axis basis.
-   Reinstating `sideEffects: false` now that the `blockViewportScroll` method has been removed.

## [2.7.2] 2020-09-24

### Added

-   `createDomMotionComponent` for legacy browser support.

## [2.7.1] 2020-09-23

### Fixed

### Fixed

-   Coercion to type `auto`.

## [2.6.2] 2020-08-26

### Fixed

-   Fixing detection of transition definitions and application of default transitions.
-   When animating to/from `0` and a unit type, `0` will be coerced to that unit type rather than needing unit conversion via DOM measurement.

## [2.6.1] 2020-08-26

### Fixed

-   Updating `useDragControls` documentation to reflect that triggering events should be `usePointerDown`, as mouse events work differently on touch screens.
-   `AnimatePresence.custom` is passed throughout the tree for all exit variants.
-   Animating the `viewBox` attribute of `svg` elements now correctly sets the `viewBox` attribute instead of `view-box`.

### Upgrade

-   Typescript 4.

## [2.6.0] 2020-08-24

### Fixed

-   Reverting relative `dragConstraints` resolution that was erroneously changed in `2.1.3`.

-   `controls.set` can now accept a function that will resolve once for each child.

## [1.6.16] 2019-11-21
