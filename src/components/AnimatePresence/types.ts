     * `AnimatePresence` locally re-renders its children once exit animations are
     * complete. This means that if surrounding or parent components are also set to `positionTransition`,
     * they aren't informed of updates to the layout when they happen asynchronous to a render.
     *
     * This prop allows `AnimatePresence` to trigger re-renders at a higher level, so more
     * components can be made aware of the layout change and animate accordingly.
     *
     * In this example, the both the parent and sibling will animate to their new layout
     * once the div within `AnimatePresence` has finished animating:
     *
     * ```jsx
     * const MyComponent = ({ isVisible }) => {
     *   const forceRender = useForceRender() // Forces a set state or something
     *
     *   return (
     *     <motion.div positionTransition>
     *       <AnimatePresence _syncLayout={forceRender}>
     *         <motion.div positionTransition exit={{ opacity: 0 }} />

     *       <motion.div positionTransition />
     *     </motion.div>
     *   )
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * In the final implementation `syncLayout` might be better as a component
     * that provides this function to children via context, or some other method
     * that obfuscates
     *
     * This isn't generally a problem for most use-cases but this capability will be useful
     * for advanced uses but also more so for phase 2 of `sizeTransition`, as we'd gain the power
     * to declaratively relayout entire parts of the page using only performant transforms.
