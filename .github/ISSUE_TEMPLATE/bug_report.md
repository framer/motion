## FAQs

### `AnimatePresence` isn't working

Have all of its immediate children got a unique `key` prop that **remains the same for that component every render**?

```jsx
// Bad: The index could be given to a different component if the order of items changes
<AnimatePresence>
  {items.map((item, index) => <Component key={index} />)}
</AnimatePresence>
```

```jsx 
// Good: The item ID is unique to each component
<AnimatePresence>
  {items.map((item, index) => <Component key={item.id} />)}
</AnimatePresence>
```

Is the `AnimatePresence` correctly outside of the controlling conditional? `AnimatePresence` must be rendered whenever you expect an `exit` animation to run - it can't do so if it's unmounted!

```jsx
// Bad: AnimatePresence is unmounted - exit animations won't run
{isVisible && (
  <AnimatePresence>
    <Component />
  </AnimatePresence>
)}
```

```jsx
// Good: Only the children are unmounted - exit animations will run
<AnimatePresence>
  {isVisible && <Component />}
</AnimatePresence>
```
