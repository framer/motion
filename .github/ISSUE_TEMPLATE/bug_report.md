## FAQs

### React Server Components `"use client"` error

If you're importing `motion` or `m` into a React Server Component environment, ensure you're importing from `framer-motion/client` instead of `framer-motion`.

```javascript
import * as motion from "framer-motion/client"
import * as m from "framer-motion/m"
```

### Framer Motion won't install

Different versions of Framer Motion are compatible with different versions of React.

React 19: `12.0.0-alpha.0` or higher
React 18: `7.0.0` to `11.x`
React 17: `6.x` or lower

### `height: "auto"` is jumping

Animating to/from `auto` requires measuring the DOM. There's no perfect way to do this and if you have also applied padding to the same element, these measurements might be wrong.

The recommended solution is to move padding to a child element. See [this issue](https://github.com/framer/motion/issues/368) for the full discussion.

### Preact isn't working

Framer Motion isn't compatible with Preact.

### `AnimatePresence` isn't working

Have all of its immediate children got a unique `key` prop that **remains the same for that component every render**?

```jsx
// Bad: The index could be given to a different component if the order of items changes
<AnimatePresence>
    {items.map((item, index) => (
        <Component key={index} />
    ))}
</AnimatePresence>
```

```jsx
// Good: The item ID is unique to each component
<AnimatePresence>
    {items.map((item, index) => (
        <Component key={item.id} />
    ))}
</AnimatePresence>
```

Is the `AnimatePresence` correctly outside of the controlling conditional? `AnimatePresence` must be rendered whenever you expect an `exit` animation to run - it can't do so if it's unmounted!

```jsx
// Bad: AnimatePresence is unmounted - exit animations won't run
{
    isVisible && (
        <AnimatePresence>
            <Component />
        </AnimatePresence>
    )
}
```

```jsx
// Good: Only the children are unmounted - exit animations will run
<AnimatePresence>{isVisible && <Component />}</AnimatePresence>
```
