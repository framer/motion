# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow performs a static analysis of your source code using
# Red Hat CodeReady Dependency Analytics.

# Scans are triggered:
# 1. On every push to default and protected branches
# 2. On every Pull Request targeting the default branch
# 3. On a weekly schedule
# 4. Manually, on demand, via the "workflow_dispatch" event

# üíÅ The CRDA Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Setup the required tool stack
# - Install the CRDA command line tool
# - Auto detect the manifest file and install the project's dependencies
# - Perform the security scan using CRDA
# - Upload the SARIF result to the GitHub Code Scanning which can be viewed under the security tab
# - Optionally upload the SARIF file as an artifact for the future reference

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
# 1. Setup the tool stack based on the project's requirement.
#    Refer to: https://github.com/redhat-actions/crda/#1-set-up-the-tool-stack
# 2. (Optional) CRDA action attempt to detect the language and install the
#    required dependencies for your project. If your project doesn't aligns
#    with the default dependency installation command mentioned here
#    https://github.com/redhat-actions/crda/#3-installing-dependencies.
#    Use the required inputs to setup the same
# 3. (Optional) CRDA action attempts to detect the manifest file if it is
#    present in the root of the project and named as per the default mentioned
#    here https://github.com/redhat-actions/crda/#3-installing-dependencies.
#    If it deviates from the default, use the required inputs to setup the same
# 4. Setup Authentication - Create the CRDA_KEY or SNYK_TOKEN.
#    Refer to: https://github.com/redhat-actions/crda/#4-set-up-authentication
# 5. (Optional) Upload SARIF file as an Artifact to download and view
# 6. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

      # 1. Setup Go, Java, Node.js or Python depending on your project type
      # 2. Setup Actions are listed below, choose one from them:
      #    - Go: https://github.com/actions/setup-go
      #    - Java: https://github.com/actions/setup-java
      #    - Node.js: https://github.com/actions/setup-node
      #    - Python: https://github.com/actions/setup-python
      #
      # Example:
      # - name: Setup Node

      # using the standard command for the project type.
      # If your project doesn't aligns with the defaults mentioned in this action, you will
      # need to set few inputs that are described here:
